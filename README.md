# BreakIn

**Project Overview**: This dynamic creation, developed using the powerful Unity Engine, combines elements of Breakout and Galaga. Brace yourself as enemies emerge from the blocks, relentlessly advancing towards your side of the screen. Your mission is clear: prevent them from breaching your defenses and depleting your precious time.

**Gameplay Mechanics**: Armed with the ability to shoot the ball, players must strategically aim to demolish both enemies and bricks. The ball rebounds upon colliding with bricks, while a direct hit obliterates the advancing foes. The ultimate objective is to obliterate all bricks before your time runs out.

**Combo System**: To empower players in their quest to break blocks, a combo meter intensifies with each successful brick hit. Upon reaching a certain threshold, the combo amplifies damage, providing a satisfying strategic layer to the game.

**Power-ups**: Elevating the gaming experience, various power-ups introduce exciting dynamics. The ghost power-up allows the ball to traverse through bricks, while the combo power-up instantaneously maximizes breaking damage. The recall power-up enables players to summon their ball back, maintaining their current combo.

**Project Purpose**: Delving into user-centered game design, this project aimed to explore the impact on playability. Collaboratively developed over four months by Evan Valencia, Zion, Tyler, and Colby, the team actively sought in-class game feedback. Their inquiries revolved around playability, fairness, comprehension of game mechanics, and overall player feedback. The result is a game that effectively communicates player actions, objectives, and item interactions, showcasing the team's dedication to a user-centric gaming experience.
